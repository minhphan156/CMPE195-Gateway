# copy the package.json and package-lock.json:
# adding this COPY instruction before running npm install or copying the application code allows us to take advantage of Docker's caching mechanism.
# At each stage in the build, Docker will check to see if it has a layer cached for that particular instruction. 
# If we change package.json, this layer will be rebuilt, but if we don't, 
# this instruction will allow Docker to use the existing image layer and skip reinstalling our node modules.

# Notes
# After building on Windows:
# SECURITY WARNING: You are building a Docker image from Windows against a non-Windows Docker host. 
# Explanation: 
# That warning was added, because the Windows filesystem does not have an option to mark a file as 'executable'. Building a linux image from a Windows machine would therefore break the image if a file has to be marked executable.
# For that reason, files are marked executable by default when building from a windows client; the warning is there so that you are notified of that, and (if needed), modify the Dockerfile to change/remove the executable bit afterwards.
